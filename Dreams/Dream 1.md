I dreamt about 2 girls and a game app. Girl 1 played the game and ended quitting/"losing", leaving girl 2 (their sister) to find an abandoned lot where there was supposed to be their house. Girl 2 takes the responsibility to decorate, invite guests and mantain pets. In the "inside-mind" house it's full of decoration (contrary to Girl 1's gameplay) and seems to be struggling with tasks. They end up having the same ending despite their efforts. Girl 1 doesn't seem bothered and tells Girl 2 they have to leave. Girl 2 is very sad about that and sings songs about leaving things behind (about 3 of them). Girl 1 and Girl 2 leave their house to live in the city with all their family.
